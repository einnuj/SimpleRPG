        <Skill_One>There is a once-handsome dark oaken long table in
        the center of this room of stone, the four walls barren. Five items lie
            atop it: a looking glass, a pair of worn leather boots, a battered
            blue book, a single iron bracer, and an impossibly
            smooth pebble. A sourceless light shines down upon the table,
            faintly illuminating the otherwise empty room.</Skill_One>

            <Description> Your gaze unnaturally wanders across the
            table to the far wall, resting on a redwood door. Its
                golden doorknob called to you.</Description>
